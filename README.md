## DrawBattle

DrawBattle is a local multiplayer battle game where two players compete to infiltrate each others' bases.
Minions are drawn in the Draw phase, which have varying amounts of health and damage depending on how it is drawn.
These minions can then be sent in the Battle phase, and do damage to one another as well as the bases of the opponent.

DrawBattle was created in 6 weeks from April to May 2017 for Mr. Kim's Java class. This is where I would grab statistics and
more detailed descriptions, if my planning document didn't get corrupted >:(

**Disclaimer:** This is an archived repository, and will not be further developed. DrawBattle was developed for a class project and will
stay that way, as the scalability of such a poorly designed game is nonexistent. 
I have uploaded this to GitHub for documentation purposes only.
