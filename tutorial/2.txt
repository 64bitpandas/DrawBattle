The first phase of the game is the Drawing
phase. This is when you can draw a minion.

The color changes the speed of the minion.
Red is 1x speed, while Dark Grey is 8x speed.
Health can also be changed.
Don't forget to change the slot! If a minion
already exists in the selected slot, then it
will be overwritten.

The minion cost is displayed on the top right.
